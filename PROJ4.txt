This project was very interesting to work on.

I believe working with the ChatClient and ChatServer really helped solidify my understanding of Sockets and how they communicate.

Originally, I was unsure what the ClientReceiver was supposed to do but after completing all the other parts of the program I was able 
to figure it out and now makes perfect sense.

I also believe that working with the ServerInputThread abd ServerOutputThread helped me develop a better understanding of threads.

Overall with the Chat classes and Server classes I feel like I've gained a much better understanding of I/O and how it works.

One of the hardest parts of this project was trying to debug and figure out what was wrong with the code. For me it was difficult trying
to figure out where I had an issue in my code. One of the biggest errors I encountered was after both Clients connected the messages from one
client wasn't being broadcasted to the other client. I spent hours looking through my code trying to switch things up and just testing but in 
the end I found the error by following through the code and writing down what was going on in a notebook. Although I eventually fixed the error
it was really frustrating after realizing it was 1 line of code that I forgot (flushing userInput into the outputStream). This however taught me
alot about coding and how you really have to pay attention to detail when coding something so that you can avoid spending hours trying to debug.

Overall I found this project really interesting as it felt like a real project with a purpose rather than just manipulating a virtual zoo
like the previous projects.
